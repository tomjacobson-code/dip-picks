# DIP PICKS — Logo Ranking & Palette Guide

## Top 5 Ranking

**1. Option 12 — "Reverse Block"**
The burnt orange pill on "DIP" with plain "PICKS" creates instant brand recognition and works at every size, from billboard to favicon.

**2. Option 15 — "DP Monogram Master"**
The shared-stroke DP monogram is the strongest icon mark in the set and gives you a true brand symbol beyond just a wordmark.

**3. Option 03 — "Block Party"**
The mustard highlight bar behind "DIP" is bold without being complicated, reads fast, and scales perfectly across packaging and digital.

**4. Option 11 — "Two Weights"**
The weight contrast between heavy "DIP" and refined "PICKS" creates visual tension that feels premium and intentional.

**5. Option 07 — "Underline Accent"**
The clean slab serif with burnt orange underline is the most versatile option, equally at home on a Shopify site or a jar label.

## Recommended Primary Palette

After reviewing against the hero image (warm tones, bold contrast, confident energy), the **base palette works well**. One adjustment: I'd warm up the teal slightly for better harmony with the hero image tones.
